/* We have not studied enum type. An enum type is a
   special data type that enables for
   a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
   The variable must be equal to one of the values
   that have been predefined for it.
   Common examples include compass directions
   (values of NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST)
   and the days of the week.
